        Wednesday, August 10, 2022.  Hot and sunny weather will allow\nozone to reach
        levels that are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups on\nTuesday and Wednesday.
        The highest concentrations of ozone are\nmost likely for locations in and
        near the Denver Metro area, as\nwell as northward along the Front Range and
        lower foothills to\ninclude Boulder, Longmont, and Fort Collins. For areas
        included in\nthis advisory that are not expected to reach the Unhealthy for\nSensitive
        Groups (USG) air quality designation, we request that\nactivities, such as
        driving non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or\ndiesel), be reduced to lessen the
        impacts on neighboring air\nquality. Additional air pollution in this region
        may directly\nworsen air quality or contribute to precursors which may also\nadversely
